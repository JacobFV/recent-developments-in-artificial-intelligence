# Recent Developments in Artificial Intelligence

This course takes the place of CSE 4391 Independant Study Project.

**Description of Course Content**: This course is designed to facilitate independent study of recent developments in artificial intelligence including (relevant for Spring 2022):
- advanced neural network architecture design: graph neural networks, sparse neural networks with attention, structured high-dimensional latent representation, multimodal architectures, multi-task learning, and more.  
- modern approaches to reinforcement learning including Q-learning, DDQ-learing, SAC, PPO, DDPG, TD3, TRPO, DREAMER, and other methods.
- self-supervised, unsupervised, and reward-free learning methods including autoencoding, autoregression, contrastive methods, meta learning, model-agnostic meta-learning, as well as hyperparameter optimization, intrinsically motivated RL, inverse reinforcement learning, and others.
- distributed and centralized model deployment and training.

**Prerequisites**: Programming Languages (CSE 3302), Theoretical Concepts (CSE 3315), and Machine Learning (CSE 4309). Artificial Intelligence (CSE 4308) is required as a corequisite. Department consent is also required for students to take this course.

**Student Learning Outcomes**: After successfully taking this course, students should be able to:
- implement and evaluate neural network architectures for general-purpose anthrocentric problem domains such as image classification, text classification, and speech recognition as well as exotic challanges such as music generation, humanoid robot control, and intelligent process automation.
- formally communicate research results and developments to the machine learning and broader computer science community.

**Assignments**: Students will identify 5 independent projects related to a recent development in artificial intelligence to complete in the course. The instructor must approve of each project. Students must write a 12page NeurIPS 2021 format paper on each of their projects and submit at least one of the five to an acedemic conference. Each project will be graded on a scale of 0-100. The grade will be based on the quality of the project, the quality of the report, and the impact of the student's work on the community.

**Exams**:  There is only one exam for this course. During the exam, students will have 3 hours to train a language modeling agent to correctly answer an open-ended question. The exam will be graded on a scale of 0-100.

**Grades**:  The final grade for this course will be based on the average of the final grades for the individual projects and the exam. There are no curve-based grading schemes. Students will recieve an A for a grade of at least 90; B for a grade of at least 80; C for a grade of at least 70; D for a grade of at least 60; and F for a grade of less than 60.

**Instruction, Modality, and Schedule**:  This course is asynchronous online. Students may arange to meet with the instructor during his office hours for guidance on their research. Following is a tenative schedule for this course assignments and exam.

Announcements: Stay tuned and make sure to check Blackboard
frequently. Important announcements will be posted there.
Assignments and Deadlines
· All the assignments must be submitted through Blackboard. We will NOT
take hardcopy or email submission, unless the university verifies that
Blackboard was malfunctioning or unavailable. If you are not able to submit
through Blackboard due to its technical failure, you can email your
assignment to us, together with a screenshot showing the technical failure.
We will verify with the university.
· Everything is due by 11:59pm on the due date. The deadline is
automatically managed by Blackboard. You can still turn in assignment after
the deadline. However, you automatically lose 5 points per hour after the
due time, till you get 0. (Each individual assignment is 100 points.) We
cannot waive the penalty, unless there was a case of illness or other
substantial impediment beyond your control, with proof in documents.
· Do not send email asking for an extension for the following reasons:
o
Regrading: Regrading request must be made within 7 days after we post
scores on Blackboard. TA will handle regrade requests. If student is not
satisfied with the regarding results, you get 7 days to request again. The
instructor will regrade, and the decision is final.
Drop Policy: Students may drop or swap (adding and dropping a class
concurrently) classes through self-service in MyMav from the beginning of
the registration period through the late registration period. After the late
registration period, students must see their academic advisor to drop a class
or withdraw. Undeclared students must see an advisor in the University
Advising Center. Drops can continue through a point two-thirds of the way
through the term or session. It is the student's responsibility to officially
withdraw if they do not plan to attend after registering. By the way,
“bazinga” is the word being asked in the quiz 1. Students will not be
automatically dropped for non-attendance. Repayment of certain types of
financial aid administered through the University may be required as the
result of dropping classes or withdrawing. For more information, contact the

or requiring students to incorporate the honor code into any work submitted.
Per UT System Regents’ Rule 50101, §2.2, suspected violations of
university’s standards for academic integrity (including the Honor Code) will
be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Violators will be disciplined in
accordance with University policy, which may result in the student’s
suspension or expulsion from the University. Additional information is
available at https://www.uta.edu/conduct/.
Electronic Communication: UT Arlington has adopted MavMail as its
official means to communicate with students about important deadlines and
events, as well as to transact university-related business regarding financial
aid, tuition, grades, graduation, etc. All students are assigned a
MavMailaccount and are responsible for checking the inbox regularly. There
is no additional charge to students for using this account, which remains
active even after graduation. Information about activating and using MavMail
is available at http://www.uta.edu/oit/cs/email/mavmail.php.
Campus Carry: Effective August 1, 2016, the Campus Carry law (Senate
Bill 11) allows those licensed individuals to carry a concealed handgun in
buildings on public university campuses, except in locations the University
establishes as prohibited. Under the new law, openly carrying handguns is
not allowed on college campuses. For more information, visit
http://www.uta.edu/news/info/campus-carry/.
Student Feedback Survey: At the end of each term, students enrolled in
face-to-face and online classes categorized as “lecture,” “seminar,” or
“laboratory” are directed to complete an online Student Feedback Survey
(SFS). Instructions on how to access the SFS for this course will be sent
directly to each student through MavMail approximately 10 days before the
end of the term. Each student’s feedback via the SFS database is aggregated
with that of other students enrolled in the course. Students’ anonymity will
be protected to the extent that the law allows. UT Arlington’s effort to solicit,
gather, tabulate, and publish student feedback is required by state law and
aggregate results are posted online. Data from SFS is also used for faculty
and program evaluations. For more information, visit
http://www.uta.edu/sfs.
Final Review Week: For semester-long courses, a period of five class days
prior to the first day of final examinations in the long sessions shall be
designated as Final Review Week. The purpose of this week is to allow
students sufficient time to prepare for final examinations. During this week,
there shall be no scheduled activities such as required field trips or
performances; and no instructor shall assign any themes, research problems
or exercises of similar scope that have a completion date during or following
this week unless specified in the class syllabus. During Final Review Week,
an instructor shall not give any examinations constituting 10% or more of
the final grade, except makeup tests and laboratory examinations. In
addition, no instructor shall give any portion of the final examination during
Final Review Week. During this week, classes are held as scheduled. In
addition, instructors are not required to limit content to topics that have
been previously covered; they may introduce new concepts as appropriate.
Emergency Exit Procedures: Should we experience an emergency event
that requires us to vacate the building, students should exit the room and
move toward the nearest exit. When exiting the building during an
emergency, one should never take an elevator but should use the stairwells.
Faculty members and instructional staff will assist students in selecting the
safest route for evacuation and will make arrangements to assist individuals
with disabilities.
